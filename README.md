## Improving MRT Commuter Experience by Analyzing MRT Commuter Data
### Overview
This project aims to improve the commuting experience for MRT passengers by focusing on three main areas: Train Service Management, Station Management, and Exit Management. Our objectives include ensuring smooth boarding, reducing waiting times, minimizing overcrowding, lowering train disruption rates, maintaining station gantries functionality, and guaranteeing the safety of all commuters.

### Objectives
Train Service Management: Increase train frequency on high-demand routes to reduce waiting times and alleviate overcrowding.
Station Management: Implement safety measures and improve crowd management at stations with high commuter density.
Exit Management: Install additional gantries at stations with high exit volumes to ensure smooth commuter flow.
### Methodology
Data Analysis: Utilized Python for data analysis, focusing on commuter flow, station density, and exit volumes.
Tools and Libraries: Employed libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Networkx, csv, Itertools, and collections for data manipulation and visualization.
ChatGPT Assistance: Leveraged ChatGPT for calculating longest path betweenness centrality and determining the most popular commuting routes.
### Conclusions
Enhanced train service management by identifying and prioritizing routes with high commuter flow.
Improved station management by deploying additional resources at stations with high commuter density.
Optimized exit management by installing and maintaining additional gantries at key stations.
